title: "Fourth week - Application to write Memos"
date: 2023-02-22

It has been a month since I am learning python and I feel that there is no stop to learning with the kind of libraries that Python supports. I realized that it is an ocean.

As I wrote in my last weekâ€™s blog, I continued building on top of the application that I created. As I had the signup functionality working, the next step was to allow the users to sign in using their username and password. 
Just to recall, once the user enters the details, I stored them in a text file called "users.txt" when they sign up. The file contained the username and password of each user, separated by a colon.

Instead of creating a separate window for sign-in, I have just created a new button that does the job. Why? Because the signup and sign-in are just based on two fields. Once an existing user enters their details and clicks on the sign-in button, the application checks if the details entered by the user are correct or not against the ones stored in the "users.txt" file. Below is the code that validates the users against the database. This is where the challenge was this time. I know how to read the file and I know how to break a string on a delimiter. But I had difficulty mapping the passwords with respective usernames. This is what I wrote in the beginning. This code lets user sign in with any username and password combination from the database.

```Python
def submit_sign_in_form():
    username = username_entry.get()
    password = password_entry.get()

    # retrieve usernames and passwords from the file
    with open("users.txt", "r") as f:
        users = f.read().split("\n\n")
    usernames = [user.split("\n")[0].replace("Username: ", "") for user in users]
    passwords = [user.split("\n")[1].replace("Password: ", "") for user in users]

    if username in usernames and password in passwords:
        status_label.config(text="Login successful!")
        username_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        password_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        root.withdraw()
        show_memo_window()
        return
    else:
        status_label.config(text="Invalid username or password.")
```
That is where the dictionaries came to my rescue. I have updated my validation function and the <a href="https://github.com/AbhilashKotha/CSCI5300_LanguageLearning_Abhilash/blob/main/PythonFiles/week3/helloWorld.py">code</a> looks like below.

```Python
def submit_sign_in_form():
    username = username_entry.get()
    password = password_entry.get()

    # retrieve usernames and passwords from the file
    with open("users.txt", "r") as f:
        users = f.read().split("\n\n")

    user_dict = {}
    for user in users:
        user_lines = user.split("\n")
        username_from_file = user_lines[0].replace("Username: ", "")
        password_from_file = user_lines[1].replace("Password: ", "")
        user_dict[username_from_file] = password_from_file

    if username in user_dict and password == user_dict[username]:
        status_label.config(text="Login successful!")
        username_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        password_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        root.withdraw()
        show_memo_window()
        return
    else:
        status_label.config(text="Invalid username or password.")

```
After the user is successfully authenticated, I wanted to provide them with a new window where they could write a memo for the day. I used the Tkinter library to create a text input field where the user could write anything they want. I also added a "Save" button that would save the memo to a new text file with today's date as the filename.
The screen looks like below,

While implementing the memo-saving feature, I learned a new thing called the nested function in Python. A nested function is a function that is defined inside another function and can only be accessed from within that function (just for the scope of the parent function). I created a nested function that saves the file to a local directory.

Now that I have the option to save memos, I want the users to be able to view their memos as well. I will continue building features on this if there are still some good learnings, otherwise, I will try for a new library next week.
