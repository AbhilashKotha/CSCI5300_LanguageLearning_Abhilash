As an experienced IT professional with a background in multiple programming and scripting languages, I have decided to take on the challenge of learning **Python** this semester. Below in this post, I will briefly explain all the reasons for selecting Python.

Firstly, Python is a very popular programming language that is currently demanded by a lot of companies and recruiters. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and more. I have had some experience working with Python on a need-basis by searching on google and other AI tools, but I want to learn the language formally to get expertise on the same and I want to be able to write good and quality code without taking help from online resources. 

One thing I observed while I was working with Python was that the syntax was very simple and the code is easy to read and understand (at least when I compare it with C#).  Also, because of the fact that it is very popular nowadays, there are many resources for me to refer when I am stuck anywhere. 

For my class “Bigdata analytics” and for my work on eye-tracking last semester, I have worked with python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for bigdata visualization (Some screenshots below), and I know how much can be achieved with a single line of code with the right usage of libraries. I want to now explore more on these libraries in addition to other popular libraries and would like to become and independent developer in Python.

Finally, by the end of this semester, I want to learn Python to the extent possible. As I mentioned above, I want to take advantage of Python to improve my coding abilities and add it to my tech stack which will help me to get placed in a good company and in a good role. 

Looking forward for a lot of learning and challenges!
